Learning agda
============

Learning agda is hard without thoroughly understanding dependent type theory
Unfortunately, much of the dependent type theory, for example induction principles
aren't accessible in agda, so you can't write lowest level terms.
In this file, we declared types which are the most used for illustrative purposes
with explicit definitions with their inductive principles. There are also a number of 
excercises (with solutions) which can be used to deepen understanding of core dependent
type theory.
